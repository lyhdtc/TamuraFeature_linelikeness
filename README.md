# TamuraFeature_linelikeness
A python script to calculate linelikeness in TamuraFeature.

I can't find any code about linelikeness feature, so I write one based on the original paper <Textural Features Corresponding to Visual Perception>(https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4309999)
  
I try to use matrix instead of calculate each pixel, which can increase speed from 15000s to 12s (1920*1080 pic)
  
Anything wrong, Please tell me! Thanks!
